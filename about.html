					<h2>Facts</h2>

						<h3>Research Motivation</h3>
							<p>
								The motivation for this research is derived from my interest in video games and advertisements. On many occasions, I have stumbled upon advertisements in video games and sporadically recognized them. Those stumbles and recognitions become stimulation arousing my curiosity regarding the in-game advertisements’ capability to influence gamers’ recognition, which is one of the marketing facets called brand awareness. Moreover, having DBI as a major encourages me to delve deep into uncovering the potential of this form of commercial.  The purpose of this research is to shed light on the quality of this platform in the advertising industry using the recall and recognition rate as indicators and how to use this means of advertisement most effectively.
							</p>
							<h3>Research Importance</h3>
							<p>
								This research is important because, in the digital era, gaming is rapidly gaining popularity becoming one of the most popular forms of entertainment. Various commercials are, hence, being done through video games to reach more audiences and undeniably require funds to do so. Ergo, knowing the effectiveness of various platforms before committing an actual investment is deemed a wise notion. Other platforms, for instance, television; highway billboards; or even recent platforms like Facebook, have been proven to be effective in raising brand awareness and evoking memories of the brand. However, up until now, the researchers covering the video game platform, compared to others, are deemed quite a few, making its effect remain enigmatic compared to the other means of advertising. Understanding the concept and methods to employ in-game advertisement effectively can pave the way for both game developers and businesses aimed to place in-game ads to gain lucrative and navigate the way through the gaming industry in a digital market by choosing the best cause of action when placing in-game ads thus resulting in higher success in liabilities avoidance. 
							</p>
							<h3>Use of Research and Research Methods</h3>
							<p>
								The information is gleaned from various academic sources and consolidated into one by recapitulating each source. After that, I clarify each factor playing a role in arousing brand awareness in a logical order and ultimately present the effective strategies to utilize in-game advertisements inferred from the gleaned and recapitulated information.
							</p>
							<h3>Further research needed</h3>
							<p>
								Current data is still short of the variety of samples. Most of the information focuses on the sports genre, especially racing games. The participants from those articles are considered specific, hence too narrow to use as a reliable source to represent the general population. Broadening the genres and finding more experiments representing various participants' characteristics, whether nationality, gender, or age. Some themes’ answers, a player’s primary motivation and its effect on brand awareness; how the game’s technology affects brand awareness; and using repetitive strategy to increase brand awareness, for example, also rely heavily on only one article; seeking more articles to gain more insights and supporting evidence is a future plan.
