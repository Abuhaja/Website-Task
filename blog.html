<br><br>Stumbling upon a familiar brand inside a modern video game is now an unavoidable phenomenon. Those advertisements come in many forms, whether by recognizing the cars or familiar billboards that pop up on the track and road. Those instances result from in-game advertisements; if people notice them, they are successful ones. The gaming industry's popularity is increasing relentlessly in the digital era due to the advancement of technology resulting in the creation of myriad video games. Many businesses and advertisers have taken advantage of this phenomenon by integrating ads into video games, engendered the term “in-game advertisement” or IGA, with a desire to leave an expression of products in gamers’ memories to build brand awareness and potentially lead to the actual purchase. In-game advertisement quality and outcomes vary depending on various internal and external factors. Knowing the effect of those factors assists in formulating effective in-game advertisement strategies when one aspiration is to raise brand awareness and purchase intention.</br>    
<br>Background</br> 
In the digital era, market strategies and transactions are preferably done through the digital platform due to the great accessibility making it easier to reach more potential customers and concurrently cost less than the tangible world advertisement (Piranda et al., 2022). One of the said platforms is a gaming platform. According to Roettl & Turlutter (2018), a minimum of 60% of American households have at least one family member playing a videogame no less than 3 hours per week; moreover, US American households, approximately 65%, possess gaming-capable devices. The number of households that indulge in gaming activities is more than half of the US population, further underscoring the popularity of gaming in the digital era. Moreover, considering the fact that 65% of households have devices capable of playing games speaking of its excellent accessibility.  All things considered, gaming is considered an exceptional platform for advertising. 
Advertising through games is gradually gaining popularity, benefiting both the customer and the game itself. Zhoujie (2022) notes that the collaboration of American hip-pop singer Travis Scott and Fortnite in 2020 created massive participation and induced more than 27 million game logins to partake in the concert; additionally, at least 40 million views were generated during that time. One of the most popular means is integrating the ads into games to create realism and promote the products or ideas. Chaney et al. (2018) observe that in the current era, gaming is quickly gaining popularity receiving the title of the world's favorite pastime. Many advertisements, hence, are being done through games. The study by Nielsen and EA indicates that in-game advertising boosts real-life spending on Gatorade by 24%. In politics, they also take this opportunity to promote their party, inserting Obama's billboard advertisement in Burnout Paradise, for example (Chaney et al., 2018). 
<br><br>Definition of Terms  
<br>In-game advertisement/In-game ads(IGA):
In-game advertisement (IGA) refers to the incorporation of advertisements into computer and video games (Kim & Leng, 2018, p.43).
<br>Brand awareness:
Brand awareness is the degree of customers' awareness of the brand; it is deemed crucial to the decision-making process. The more well-known the brand is, the greater the likelihood of being chosen. Two concepts included in brand awareness are brand recall and brand recognition (Khurram et al., 2018). 
<br>Brand recall & brand recognition: 
Brand recognition and recall are regular means to measure brand awareness. Recall refers to directly retrieving brand information from the brain; recognition refers to one's capability to recognize the brand they are exposed to (Roettl & Terltter, 2018).
<br>Purchase Intention:
Purchase Intention is the tendency of consumers to buy a brand or take actions related to purchases that are measured by the level of possibility of consumers to make purchases (Belch, 2008, as cited in Takaya, 2019, p. 2).
<br><br>Controllable Factors That Contribute to the Quality of In-Game Advertisements</br>
- Size of Advertisements
<br>Larger ads lead to a better perceiver’s memorization, which is positively associated with recall and recognition rates. Large objects naturally attract more attention compared to small ones; therefore, the memory of large objects will be clearer due to the longer time they are observed. Moreover, a large object’s salience surpasses that of a small size. As evidenced by Ziraman & Imamoğlu's art exhibition experiment, the noticeable mean of 3 large objects (4.52) is 0.59 more than 18 small objects (3.93) (Ziraman & Imamoğlu, 2018). As the result indicates, even with considerably more quantities, the salience effect of large objects still triumphs over that of small objects. The explanation for this instance is that large exhibition pieces overshadow the smaller ones due to their noticeability captivating more perceiver’s attention. The found concept can be applied to the IGA field as well. Using Trackmania 2 Canyon, a racing car game, as a selected game for an experiment, Chaney et al. (2018) discovered that the recall and recognition rate was the highest in participants placed on the track with large-sized billboards. On the contrary, the other groups, the small-size billboards and the authentic track groups, had an inferior performance on the test result. In racing games, players’ focus is mainly on the track due to this game genre’s nature requiring fast reactions resulting in less time spent observing surroundings, which can lead to missing most small details. Having notable-size ads can alleviate the problems to some extent by creating a potent salience effect that even when players focus on other things, they can still notice the ads to some degree. Knowing that larger objects captivated more attention, advertisers and game producers can utilize this knowledge by magnifying the ads' size and consequently amplifying the ads’ salience generating more awareness from players. 
<br>- Ads’ Location
<br>Integrating ads in the center location can evoke more brand memory from players due to being the focal point. When the area of the advertisement is paramount, the likelihood of overlooking details will be less due to the attention focused on the advertisement. The outcome of Williams' (2020) experiment, conducted by using a high-intensity driving game “Midnight Club: Los Angeles (MC: LA)” as a selected game, indicates that the recognition rate of brands placed in the center of the screen was higher than those subtly placed. The group playing the game with ads in the center of the screen has a recognition rate of 33 percent. The group with peripheral ads, on the other hand, has a recognition rate of just over 9 percent. The high-intensity driving games require the utmost attention to the track. Normally, the track will be at the center of the screen, which means the player’s attention will linger on the screen’s center for the majority of the playing time unless the unexpected peripheral track arises. Still, the special track is transitory and will revert to the center-screen track in a matter of mere seconds. This theory also extends to other game genres. For instance, an experiment conducted by ZhouJie (2022) through Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, a famous mobile multiplayer online battle arena(MOBA) game, shows that embedding Netflix ads in character skin generates more purchase intention than integrating ads into a turret by a mean of 48.15 and 45.03, respectively.  In MOBA genre games, your character never leaves the center of the screen; the only time the screen’s center briefly shifts away from your character is when you deliberately reposition it to observe the peripheral part of the map. Turrets, in contrast, are stationary and require the player to be in the turrets’ line of sight for them to manifest on screen. Thus, the likelihood of seeing turrets is less than seeing the character, which leads to lower purchase intention. In both cases, ads that are in the screen’s center can attract more attention and purchase intention from players. Advertisers and game developers, therefore, should consider this fact and place ads in the center of the screen to increase product awareness and sales. 
<br><br>Uncontrollable Factors That Contribute to the Quality of In-Game Advertisement
<br>- Repetitive Effects
By repeatedly exposing players to ads, players will become more acquainted with the ads. The repetitive exposure creates more opportunities for players to notice integrated ads and brands also have more opportunities to instill their propaganda into the viewers’ memories, thus instilling firmer memories (Khurram et al, 2018). Participants who participated and were exposed to ads 7 times in Kim & Leng’s experiment, playing Madden NFL and answering the question, scored better in both recall(2.27) and recognition(2.40) tests than those with 3(recall: 1.66, recognition: 1.87) exposures and 1(recall: 0.73, recognition: 0.87) exposure (Kim & Leng, 2017, pp. 52-53). 7 times-exposed participants saw ads 7 times, whereas 3 and 1 times-exposed groups saw only 3 and 1, respectively. Therefore, 7 times would be more familiar with ads and have greater memory regarding them. Furthermore, customers tend to buy from the brands that they are familiar with; exposing them to brand images several times is going to create familiarity and engender purchase intention (Rhee & Jung, 2018). Kim & Leng’s experiment illustrates that players who have been exposed to ads 7 times(4.23) have higher purchase intention than those with 1 exposure(3.66) (Kim & Leng, 2017, p. 53). Kim & Leng's experiment result is aligned with Rhee & Jung’s notion that the more exposed, the more familiarity, and ultimately more purchase intention. To elucidate using the aforementioned experiment, 7 times exposures generate more purchase intentions than 1 exposure from players due to those with 7 times exposure feeling more familiar with the brand resulting in higher purchase intentions. This information is crucial to game developers; their game has to be played more than once to achieve the sponsors’ desired amount of brand awareness and purchase intention. The more, the better. Hence, despite the fact that they can not control gamers to play their game repeatedly, they can design their game to have high replayability, for example, a game with various outcomes depending on players' choices to make them have an urge to try other routes or an endless runner video game like Subway Surfers and Pepsiman.
<br>- Other Uncontrollable Factors Affecting the Quality of IGA
<br>* Dizziness from advanced platforms lessens gammers' ability to memorize ads. The contemporary available game platforms are 2D, 3D, and VR. The more modern the platform is, the more cognition is required resulting in more dizziness, and dizziness undermining the players’ memorization (Roettl & Terltter, 2018). Using Roettl & Terltter's (2018) experiment as a reference, participants’ brand memories differ depending on technologies (2D, 3D, and VR). When one’s objective is to instill brand images, the 2D platform proved to be the most successful technology, followed by 3D and VR respectively. Participants who played the game on a platform that requires less cognition remembered more ads as a result. Nowadays, one game can be played on different platforms, for example, Skyrim which has both 3D and VR versions. Unfortunately, developers and advertisers can not control which platforms gamers are going to use. Therefore, in the present study, the use of this information is limited. This information, however, can be used in future studies concerning the dizziness created while gaming and how to reduce it.
<br>* Motivations vary the magnitude of ads’ potentness. Nowadays, game achievements are not bound only by game developers, they can be things that gamers create by themselves to satisfy their self-interests. Stavljanin et al. (2018) discuss that there are 3 main primary self-created objectives: to collect in-game achievement, immersion, and socialization. Those self-created achievements drive gamers into committing actions that align with their goals and later determine their play styles. Consequently, those play styles determine the extent of the player's memory of the brand. In the experiment, players whose primary objective was to collect in-game achievement had the best recall rate (67.9%), followed by those whose objective was immersion (62.5%), and then social as the lowest (38.2%) (Stavljanin et al., 2018). When one’s desire is to collect achievements or immerse oneself into the game's environment, the attention spent on observing the surrounding environment will be much greater than those whose objective lies in communicating due to the fear of missing out on details. Thus, they can retrieve and discern more ads and remember more in the process. By keeping this fact in mind while developing a game, developers, to some extent, can steer the direction of gamers’ play style by designing a game that encourages immersive and collective achievements rather than socializing achievement; a single-player game to minimize the socializing or a game with deep lore and gorgeous world to encourage players to explore the world instead of communicate with each other are ideal for IGA.
<br>* Players with greater experience possess a keener perception. Gamers with more familiarity with the game require less effort to play it than those who are unfamiliar, hence they have more brain power to process other irrelevant information such as environment and tiny details than solely on the game objective resulting in them recalling more brands. Kim & Leng (2017) found that veteran gamers scored far better than novices in the recall test. The mean score of experienced players is 1.62; inexperienced players’ mean is, however, only 0.82. The effort required to navigate through the game differs among the participants. Veterans have more expertise than novices; thus they have more attention to spend on other parts of the game; they perceive more detail and remember more in return. However, it is next to impossible to know every player's expertise, and not feasible to limit access to the game to only experienced players which is going to cause more harm than good. The possible use of this information is to place more ads in high-level or high-difficulty areas where the veteran players are, in the hope that they are going to notice them.    
<br><br>Conclusion
<br>Effective strategies can be formulated by comprehending the controllable and uncontrollable factors concerning in-game advertisements. To recapitulate the findings, IGA works best under the following instances: for controllable factors, big-size positioned in the screen’s center are proven to be the most successful; for uncontrollable factors, a game with a 2D platform repeatedly played by experienced players whose achievement is either collection or immersion. To reach those ideal instances, game developers and sponsors have to formulate a plan by placing ads in the center of the screen, magnifying the ads' size to be suitable for the ease of perceiver, designing a game that captivates people attention making them want to immerse or collect achievement, and lastly predict the characteristic of the targeted gamers to understand and predict their action. Nonetheless, one has to be aware of the possibility of backfiring, if the ads do not align with the game atmosphere, the reaction will be negative instead (ZhouJie, 2022). In the digital era, gaming is rapidly gaining popularity becoming one of the most popular forms of entertainment. Various commercials are, hence, being done through video games to reach more audiences. Ergo, studying the essential factors, which can be used to formulate an advertisement plan, before committing an actual investment is deemed a wise notion. Up until now, the researches covering the video game platform, compared to others, are deemed quite a few, making its important factors remain enigmatic and vague compared to the other means of advertising. Understanding and making use of those in-game advertisements crucial factors effectively can pave the way for both game developers and businesses aimed to place in-game ads to gain lucrative and navigate the way through the gaming industry in a digital market by formulating a good in-game advertisement plan leading to higher success in building brand awareness and liabilities avoidance.
